  This picture shows me holding up my beaglebone
  
connected.png:
  This picture shows the output of ifconfig. It also shows that I changed the name
  from root@beaglebone to root@104780881. In wlan0, it shows the inet address to be 164.67.124.254
  
copy.png:
  This picture shows filezilla when I transfered helloworld.c from my computer to beaglebone
  
build_run.png:
  This picture shows that I was connected to the beaglebone from a WIFI SSH (shown on the top tab)
  using root@164.67.124.254. This picture also shows me compiling the helloworld.c program into
  an executable and running the executable

git.png:
  This picture shows me on root@164.67.124.254, which is the WIFI SSH. It also shows me installing
  git using sudo apt-get install git-core. Then it shows me cloning the UCLA-Plasma-Simulation-Group (since I don't have anything on my own github). It also shows me going into the OSHUN directory and using ls to show what's in the directory.
note: had to use windows on my macbook pro through bootcamp because mac driver was not 
working. 

note2: my macbook broke halfway through the project so I had to switch to my surface pro 4.
