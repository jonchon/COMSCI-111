lab1b-client.c:
	contained the source code that becomes the client. It supports the flags --log to log all
	data received and sent, --port to specify the port that the server and client will talk through
	and --encrypt which encrypts and decrypts the data when sending and receiving from the server

lab1b-server.c:
	Contains the source code that becomes the client. It supports the flags --port and --encrypt,
	which do the same as the lab1b-client.c's --port and --encrypt

my.key:
	Contains the key that the encryption uses to decrypt the message between client and server

Makefile:
	default builds the executable files lab1b-client and lab1b-server from lab1b-client.c
	and lab1b-server.c respectively. It also has make clean that removes the executables
	and the tar file. It has make dist that creates the tar file.
