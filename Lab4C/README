lab4c_tcp.c:
Builds off of lab4b and establishes a TCP connection with the server. This program
sends temperature reports to the server and also processes the commands sent to it
by the server. Accepts host and port arguments to connect to the proper server

lab4c_tls.c:
Simlar to lab4c_tcp.c, but instead establishes an SSL connection with the server.

Makefile:
Supports the targets default, clean, and dist. default creates lab4c_tcp and lab4c_tls
, which are executables from the files lab4c_tcp.c and lab4c_tls.c respectively.
Clean removes the executables and the tarball file. Dist creates the tarball file.
