breakpoint.png
This photo shows the value of a pointer in gdb interface right before a segmentation fault. It shows that the value of
the pointer is NULL.

Makefile
The Makefile includes make clean, make check, and make dist to remove the files, run a smoke test, and create the tar respectively.

Smoke test
The smoke test includes tests for every single exit code. exit(2) has two tests: one for a non-existing input file
and another for a non-writable output file. In addition, a test to compare an input file and output file was done
in order to confirm that input output redirection was successful.
